**University**

<ins> Project aim: </ins> to learn how to use interfaces

<ins>Project description(task): </ins>

1. Entities: student, university, teacher
2. The entities are fields of each other depending on the logic. 
3. Create interfaces with actions of instructor, student. (three interfaces, one with common actions, and 1 each with unique behavior for these 2 entities)
4. in _Main class, main() method, call the service that runs the student methods and demonstrate some of the behavior methods
5. in the _Main class, main() method call the service that runs the teacher methods and demonstrate some of the behavior methods
6. create several entities, initialize the fields, and start the demonstration methods of the services by passing objects to them.
7. the behavior itself should be launched using interfaces (service methods should accept parameters of the interface type)
